## What is it?
*bakend* (prononuced ˈbeɪkˈɛnd) is a simple yet powerful general purpose JS backend. With basically **infinite scalability** in mind, *bakend* is designed to fulfill every developer's needs with its features.

## Why choose bakend?
When designing *bakend* we, BakerySoft, aimed to eliminate all and every inconvinience one could experience with traditional backend libraries. During an extensive R&D process, we have ruled out that the main issue average developers have with them is the need of **rapid modifications** to the code, which requires constant presence and cooperation of front- and backend developers.

## What solutions does bakend provide?
With *bakend*, we have managed to reduce the need of cooperation by **100%**. This is achieved simply by following the KISS principle down to the core.
After the initial setup process, backend developers are no longer needed with the use of *bakend* - everything can be done by frontend developers, thus reducing the amount of people required for a project to progress by roughly **50%**.
